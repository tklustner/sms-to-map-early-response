# sms-to-map-early-response
This data pipeline turns incoming SMS reports from affected communities into verified, mapped humanitarian needs data in near real time.

Goal: Support bottom-up early response coordination in disaster and conflict zones by giving responders a public, map-based view of urgent needs.

## How It Works

1. SMS Intake  
   - People in the field send short text reports describing their situation (location, needs, threats, people affected).  

2. Verification  
   - Volunteers use a secure interface to review each report, confirm details, and approve for public release.  

3. Public Map  
   - Verified reports appear on a live, interactive map with filters for location, needs, and threat type.

## Why This Matters

- Low-tech, high-reach: Works via basic SMS, no smartphones or internet required for senders.  
- Community-driven: Reports come directly from affected people, not just official channels.  
- Fast situational awareness: Verified data helps responders see emerging needs and direct resources quickly.
